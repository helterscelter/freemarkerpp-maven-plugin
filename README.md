freemarkerpp-maven-plugin
=========================

Fork of the freemarkerpp-maven-plugin (https://code.google.com/p/freemarkerpp-maven-plugin)
due to the lack of activity on the original freemarkerpp-maven-plugin.

# Fork

  Since the original freemarkerpp-maven-plugin resides on code.google.com as a svn repository, this FORK was 
  created using the GIT svn module:

    git svn clone http://freemarkerpp-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ freemarkerpp-maven-plugin



# Future plans

  * integrate the Maven build environment into the default data hash.
